# Zig JavaScript Canvas Experiment

Using Scott Redig's awesome Zig-JavaScript project at <https://github.com/scottredig/zig-javascript-bridge> to use Zig to do some simple canvas drawing.

## Task

There's a `Taskfile.yml` for <https://taskfile.dev/>, a really handy tool!

It containts the build and run instructions and assumes you have <https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server> installed and available on the path.
