# Simple Zig with WebUI skeleton.

Project to create a [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) application that uses the local Chrome browser as a UI via the [WebUI](https://github.com/webui-dev/zig-webui) library.

# Requirements

Zig, that should be it.

## Makefile

For your convenience, there's a `make` file to simplify things a bit.

Options:
- `run` Runs the application
- `clean` Cleans the 'zig-out' directory
- `build` Builds a binary for the current OS
